            <p><em><strong>Perspective/Viewpoint:</strong></em><br /><br /> The
            first person subjective viewpoint is the best way to tell <em>your
            personal story.</em> That's
            because the story is about YOU, and only you can best explain your
            experience, how <em>you felt</em>,
            and illustrate in words the transformational results.
                First person narrative includes: descriptions of people/place/things,
            feelings/emotions, colors/sounds, dialogue, etc.<em> </em> Paint
            a picture to <em>show</em> the reader your feelings, your impressions, your pivotal moments (epiphanies, revelations, "aha!" moments, etc.), so they can <em>see </em>exactly what you saw, <em>feel </em>what you felt, and better
            <em>understand your unique
            transformational journey</em>!<p>
            <br /> <em><strong>Character:</strong></em> You
            are unique <em>because</em> of who you are, because of your particular "character," and you
            have survived whatever life has thrown at you! The question is WHY? 
                Strength
            of character is <em>key</em> in your triumph! Describe what made you strong (even if you didn't
            think you were at the time it all happened!) Character is almost <em>more</em> important than the events of your story-what happened to you may
            not be unique, but the reader is learning how you dealt with it in
            your own, specific, unique way... <p>
            <br /> <em><strong>Context: </strong></em> The
            "BASIC FIVE's" of all writing:  The Who, What, Where, How and
            When of your story.  Be sure not to neglect them, for they present a
            context into which your readers "enter" your story. 
               "When"
            and "where" are settings that allow the reader to place you in
            time and location.  "What" explains the
            challenges/obstacles/goals you came into contact with that created
            your dilemma, problem, issue.
               "Who"
            represents any of the players with whom you came into contact during
            your transformational journey.  And "Why" is the most important
            question of all!  Why are you writing about your experience now? 
            What did you learn, gain, modify or change? <p>
            <br /> <em><strong>Conflict: </strong></em> All
            good writing (both fiction <em>and </em>non-fiction) is based on
            drama.  And drama cannot occur without CONFLICT.  Identify and
            describe your major conflict: Was it internal or external? The three
            major themes in all of good literature include: Man vs. God; Man vs.
            Man; and Man vs. Nature.
               Which
            conflict was your transformational battle about?  Did you battle your
            inner 
            demons
            and/or your intuition, <em>or</em> did you challenge your best friend, boss, mother,
             doctor,
            significant other?  Or is your story one of survival against the
            forces of nature-an accident, a loss, a natural disaster, etc? 
            <br /> <em><strong>Writing
            Guidelines:</strong></em></p>
            <ul>
            <li>Keep
            	your sentences short--run-on sentences can be confusing! Try to
            	limit them to a 40 word max as a rule of thumb! Limit paragraphs to
            	2-3 sentences. </li>
            <li>Use
            	"active" verbs: instead of "is," "am," "are," "was,"
            	"were," or other derivatives of the verb "to be," substitute
            	verbs that <em>show us action</em>... </li>
            <li>Employ
            	"modifiers," i.e., descriptive terms... </li>
            <li>Avoid
            	the use of "passive" tense.  Any "-ing" or "ly" can be
            	made active </li>
            <li>Use
            	quotes when appropriate to liven up your copy </li>
            </ul>
            <p><br /> For example, replace
             "<em><strong>I
            was running down the street carrying my shoes in my hand, not even
            paying attention to where I was going so quickly." </strong></em> with
            "<em><strong>I
            raced down the crowded street, shoes clutched in one hand, oblivious
            to the noises of the city and the people who stopped to stare." </strong></em> <br /> <em><strong>Structure:</strong></em> Include
            a beginning, middle and end.  Simple as that!  Start with a basic
            outline and fill it in-you only have a maximum of 1,500 words, so
            build your story carefully, making sure it flows naturally. Eliminate
            the unnecessary
                A
            very good exercise to help you hone in on your "real" story would
            be to try to journal.  This is a common technique in writing personal
            stories, for it allows the free flow of information to hit the page
            without censorship.  In other words, <em>don't
            think, just write</em>-what
            happened? How did it feel? What did others say to you or you to them?
            What did it all look like? 
               Oftentimes
            your story will come alive when you write down your thoughts,
            feelings, and impressions without any goal in mind.  Perhaps you
            thought your story was about one thing, but journaling helps you
            narrow it to a more specific topic.  Let us in to see what that is
            and how it affected your transformation into the person you have
            become!
               Good
            writing involves <em>revealing
            yourself:</em> it is the act of
            revealing that allows your audience to "connect" with you!  How
            can the reader connect if she cannot understand the <em>emotions </em>behind<em> </em>what happened? Your
            transformation was <em>emotional,</em> with a before, during and after-what were the <em>specifics</em> of yours?
            <br /> <em><strong>Think
            of Your Story as Symbolic: </strong></em> Life
            as Myth: Yours is the "hero's journey"--you were plucked from
            ordinary life, forced to embark on a journey that involved transiting
            into the metaphorical underworld...there you faced the dragon, slayed
            him, and--triumphant!--gained the gift of enlightenment. You then
            brought that insight back to the world to share it with your "tribe."
               What
            are you "privileged" now to know? What is it that you have to
            share? Now that you are a "hero," what is the <em>point</em> of your transformational journey? 
            <br /> <em><strong>Get
            Started!</strong></em> Remember,
            an editor will help shape your article into the best it can be! It's
            your story that's important, so don't obsess about too many
            details.  Make sure you run through this checklist and smooth out any
            rough edges.  
            <br /> Be
            as clear, concise, and as straightforward as possible so as not to
            confuse the reader.  Get to the point in a simple, direct manner by
            using words that <em>move</em> and descriptions that <em>resonate, </em>and you will captivate
            your readers and leave them satisfied!
